# Running DaNetwork TestNet
To download the TestNet project from GitHub, open a command line and execute the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/DaNetworkTech/TestNet
```

Once downloaded, navigate to the TestNet directory and make the danetwork-linux-amd64 binary executable by running:
```
cd TestNet
chmod u+x danetwork-linux-amd64
```
After changing the permissions, run the test chain using the node.toml configuration file as a parameter. To start the test chain, enter the following command in the command line:
```
./danetwork-linux-amd64 --config node.toml
```
Note: Make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies and tools to build, run, and test the software successfully.
